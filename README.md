Project 1 
===========

This package is build as a part of the CSC1034: Portfolio-1.

Type `python walking_panda.py` to see a moving panda rotating.

Type `python walking_panda.py --no-rotate` to see a moving panda.

Type `python walking_panda.py --scale` to change the size of the panda.

I have never used trigonometry in python ,but it was fun using it to rotate the camera around. I know I will use it
more often when I will learn more about pandas and will create more 3D models.
