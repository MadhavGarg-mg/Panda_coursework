Madhav Garg Practical 1: Reflective Report
================

I used python before starting the class and had already previously created some projects and expected the project to be 
easy considering it was the first project, but it was way more interesting and engaging that I could have previously
imagined. I have gained a lot more experience using new libraries and search their documentations. This project has
made me realise how fun python can be as there are many libraries you can explore.

GitHub
--------------

Initially working on GitHub was like walking a tightrope with my feet in a bucket but as the weeks passed, I became very
comfortable using GitHub and I realised the importance of version control. I liked version control as I did use it to
refer to earlier code to write better code.

Module - simpleaudio
--------------
I was really excited to learn to add an audio file to code, and I was astonished to see how easy it was to add audio.
I will definitely use it a lot more when I create personal projects.  

Module - argparse
--------------
The best of the project had to be adding the arguments. It was fun adding arguments and looking at the panda or the 
scenery change accordingly getting instant visual confirmation.
