Madhav Garg Project 1: Reflective Report
================

I used python before starting the class and had already previously created some projects and expected the project to be 
easy considering it was the first project, but it was way more interesting and engaging than I could have previously
imagined. I have gained a lot more experience using new libraries and using their documentation properly.
This project has made me realize how fun python can be as there are many libraries you can explore.

GitHub
--------------

Initially working on GitHub was like walking on a tightrope with my feet in a bucket but as the weeks passed, I became very
comfortable using GitHub and I realized the importance of version control. I am definitely going to start doing my personal 
projects directly on GitHub and take advantage of the variety of its features.

Version Control
--------------
Learning about version control has to be one of the most important lessons I took from this project. It also has to be 
my favorite feature of GitHub I liked version control as it is a very important tool when it comes to coding, previously 
I have had many days where I change some code and my code starts to bug and I am unable to reach the initial stage, but now using version control I have realized that I could have avoided that by referring to previous versions.

Module - simple audio
--------------

I was really excited to learn to add an audio file to code, and I was astonished to see how easy it was to add audio.
I will definitely use it a lot more when I create personal projects.  

Module - argparse
--------------

The best of the project had to be adding the arguments. It was fun adding arguments and looking at the panda or the 
scenery change accordingly getting instant visual confirmation. 

Markdown
--------------
I had never used markdown before but I felt that markdown was very easy to use. I also liked how we have to 
explain what our program does in the markdown file so everyone has an easier time understanding the code.


Licensing
--------------

Learning to license files properly is a great skill to have learned as it can save us from any future plagiarism claims.

Terminal
--------------
Before starting this project I always felt that the terminal was just a useless tool for python, but now I have realized
that the terminal is an important tool for coding. We can install packages directly from the terminal and pass some 
arguments.

Conclusion
--------------
Overall this Project has been really enjoyable and a great learning source not only for python but also for the 
ways the computer science community uses professional tools. I can not wait to see what we have to do for the next
project.
