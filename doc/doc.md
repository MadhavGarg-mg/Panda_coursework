Madhav Garg Project 1: Reflective Report
================

Python
----------------
I used python before starting the class and had previously created some projects.
I expected the project to be easy considering it was the first project, but it very interesting and engaging. 
I have gained more experience using new libraries and their documentation properly.
This project has made me realize how fun python is with many libraries and functionalities to explore.

GitHub
--------------

I never used GitHub, I only knew that it existed. 
This project gave me an opportunity to learn about GitHub and how important of a tool it is for aspiring computer scientists.
As the weeks passed, I became comfortable using GitHub and realised the importance of tracking my progress on the projects. 
I am hoping to incorporate it into my personal projects and take advantage of the variety of its features. 

Version Control
--------------
Version control has become my favorite feature on GitHub.
I like version control as it is a vital tool when it comes to coding, previously if I changed some code 
and it developed a bug, I was only able to reach the initial stage by using ctrl + Z repeatedly.
Now, using version control I can avoid that by referring to previous versions directly.

Library - simpleaudio
--------------

Having never done this before, I was really excited to add an audio file to the code. Due to this project, I had an 
opportunity to do so and I was astonished to see how easy it was to add an audio file. Now I have the opportunity to 
be unique by using this library.  

Library - argparse
--------------
I had previously used arguments in python functions, although, I had never compiled them in a visual file before.
It was an exciting experience to see the panda and the scenery change according to my arguments and it was 
satisfying to get an instant visual confirmation.

Markdown
--------------
Using markdown files was new to me, but after exploring it was easy to use. 
I also liked explaining what my program does in the markdown file so everyone can interact with the code
with or without any technical knowledge.


Licensing
--------------

Learning to license files properly is a great skill to have learned because I can protect my own Intellectual property and 
credit the work of my collaborators or the university.

Terminal
--------------
Before starting this project, I always felt that the terminal was a useless tool for python as I was mostly working in 
Jupyter notebooks before. Now I have realized that the terminal is an important tool for coding. 
We can install packages directly from the terminal and pass some 
arguments, we can also use GitHub directly from the terminal and track the progress of our projects.

Conclusion
--------------
Overall this Project has been tremendously enjoyable and a great learning source not only for python but also for the 
ways we can use professional tools. I can not wait to see what we have to do for the next project.
